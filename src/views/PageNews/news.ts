      '<p>Computer scientist <a href="https://www.ontier.digital/post/bitcoin-creator-launches-ip-claims-against-digital-currency-exchanges">Craig Wright</a> continues litigation against those who challenge his claims of being the creator of Bitcoin and holder of associated intellectual property.</p>\n<p>This time, crypto exchanges Coinbase and Kraken are in the firing line over misrepresenting &#8220;Bitcoin Core&#8221; as the actual Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Wright&#8217;s legal team states further filings against major exchanges are in the pipeline. They say litigation is necessary &#8220;<span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">to prevent future misperceptions as to the true operational nature of Bitcoin</span>.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">This litigation is the latest in a series of legal claims issued by ONTIER LLP on behalf of Dr Wright and his associated entities to uphold his right to protect his lawfully-held digital assets, his reputation as the creator of Bitcoin and his associated intellectual property</span>&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Proceedings were filed <span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">on April 29, 2022, and will be heard at the Business and Property Courts of England and Wales.

However, the actual Bitcoin is distinct and separate from the protocol Wright claims to have created in 2009.</p>\n<p>According to Wright, the real Bitcoin, i.e., the one that remains true to the original protocol, is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV).</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">&#8220;The Claimants assert that these exchanges, and others, have been trading – and encouraging investors and consumers to trade and invest – in BTC, by passing off that asset as Bitcoin.&#8221;</span></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The proceedings assert that <span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">misrepresentations by Coinbase and Kraken, who continue to push BTC as the original Bitcoin, have confused crypto investors who are unaware of the &#8220;authenticity&#8221; of the assets they are dealing with.</span></p>\n<p>Wright is seeking an injunction to stop Coinbase and Kraken from misleading investors through the &#8220;improper use&#8221; of signs or wording that promote BTC as Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Based on the defendant&#8217;s revenues, Wright&#8217;s legal team expects the claim to be worth several billions of pounds.</p>\n<h2>Update on ongoing defamation lawsuits</h2>\n<p>The What Bitcoin Did Podcast host, Peter McCormack, gave an <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMcCormack/status/1520086331686273031">update</a> on his ongoing legal dispute with Wright last week.

Wright responded by instigating a libel claim on the <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Wright-v-Mccormack-Final-Judgment.pdf">grounds</a> that McCormack damaged his reputation.</p>\n<p>Magnus Granath, AKA Twitter handle <a href="https://twitter.com/hodlnaut">@hodlnaut</a>, met a similar response after also challenging claims that Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto. Wright&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ontier.digital/post/bitcoin-creator-launches-ip-claims-against-digital-currency-exchanges">legal team</a> says the defamation trial will likely be heard in early 2023.</p>\n<p>Last year, London&#8217;s High Court ruled in favor of Wright in his <a href="https://cryptoslate.com/uk-rules-in-favor-of-craig-wright-in-bitcoin-org-whitepaper-case/">legal action</a> against the operator of the bitcoin.org website.

      '<p>Luxury fashion retailer Philipp Plein is set to open a store in London&rsquo;s Mayfair on Thursday, with the unique option for customers to pay for their purchases in crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Last year, Phillip Plein claimed to be the first fashion brand to accept payment in both fiat and cryptocurrency in their bricks-and-mortar retail stores and online. Now, the german brand is taking their store to London.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fashion store will initially open as a pop-up, with plans to permanently open over five storeys on the iconic Bond street. As an early adopter of technology in the fashion world, Philipp Plein was one of the first fashion brands to develop an in-house e-commerce platform, as well as advocate for the use of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>The Bond street flagship store has revealed it will accept 20 of the leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and expects around 5% of its sales to be paid in cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We chose London first partly because the British government made a big statement about being a world leader in cryptocurrency and it announced plans to mint its own NFT (non-fungible-token) a few weeks ago.Also because London is a huge financial hub and one of the most important cities in the world. We got an opportunity to test it with an international audience in a prime location. If we want to play with the big boys we have to be here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In a press release last year, Phillip Plein set out the fashion brands intention to accept cryptocurrency as payment, noting:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I believe that cryptocurrencies are the future and my team and I have made a major commitment in time and resources, performing all necessary system modifications to adopt this new type of currency,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Phillip Plein shared his personal views on crypto and the future of digital currencies, via Twitter, noting the following:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I am a crypto investor and I believe in the future of CRYPTO - this is why I decided to offer this payment method in my stores and online !!!! have fun guys and enjoy shooting CRYPTO COINS in our wallet - together we are making HISTORY&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>With the UK recently laying out plans for London to become a &lsquo;global hub&rsquo; for crypto, and city minister John Glen stating &ldquo;the UK is open for business and open for crypto businesses&rdquo;, it seems a fitting time for Philipp Plein to announce the launch of their crypto-forward flagship store in London.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

However, the actual Bitcoin is distinct and separate from the protocol Wright claims to have created in 2009.</p>\n<p>According to Wright, the real Bitcoin, i.e., the one that remains true to the original protocol, is Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV).</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong><span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">&#8220;The Claimants assert that these exchanges, and others, have been trading – and encouraging investors and consumers to trade and invest – in BTC, by passing off that asset as Bitcoin.&#8221;</span></strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>The proceedings assert that <span class="_2PHJq public-DraftStyleDefault-ltr">misrepresentations by Coinbase and Kraken, who continue to push BTC as the original Bitcoin, have confused crypto investors who are unaware of the &#8220;authenticity&#8221; of the assets they are dealing with.</span></p>\n<p>Wright is seeking an injunction to stop Coinbase and Kraken from misleading investors through the &#8220;improper use&#8221; of signs or wording that promote BTC as Bitcoin.</p>\n<p>Based on the defendant&#8217;s revenues, Wright&#8217;s legal team expects the claim to be worth several billions of pounds.</p>\n<h2>Update on ongoing defamation lawsuits</h2>\n<p>The What Bitcoin Did Podcast host, Peter McCormack, gave an <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMcCormack/status/1520086331686273031">update</a> on his ongoing legal dispute with Wright last week.

      '<p>Luxury fashion retailer Philipp Plein is set to open a store in London&rsquo;s Mayfair on Thursday, with the unique option for customers to pay for their purchases in crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Last year, Phillip Plein claimed to be the first fashion brand to accept payment in both fiat and cryptocurrency in their bricks-and-mortar retail stores and online. Now, the german brand is taking their store to London.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fashion store will initially open as a pop-up, with plans to permanently open over five storeys on the iconic Bond street. As an early adopter of technology in the fashion world, Philipp Plein was one of the first fashion brands to develop an in-house e-commerce platform, as well as advocate for the use of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>The Bond street flagship store has revealed it will accept 20 of the leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and expects around 5% of its sales to be paid in cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We chose London first partly because the British government made a big statement about being a world leader in cryptocurrency and it announced plans to mint its own NFT (non-fungible-token) a few weeks ago.Also because London is a huge financial hub and one of the most important cities in the world. We got an opportunity to test it with an international audience in a prime location. If we want to play with the big boys we have to be here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In a press release last year, Phillip Plein set out the fashion brands intention to accept cryptocurrency as payment, noting:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I believe that cryptocurrencies are the future and my team and I have made a major commitment in time and resources, performing all necessary system modifications to adopt this new type of currency,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Phillip Plein shared his personal views on crypto and the future of digital currencies, via Twitter, noting the following:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I am a crypto investor and I believe in the future of CRYPTO - this is why I decided to offer this payment method in my stores and online !!!! have fun guys and enjoy shooting CRYPTO COINS in our wallet - together we are making HISTORY&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>With the UK recently laying out plans for London to become a &lsquo;global hub&rsquo; for crypto, and city minister John Glen stating &ldquo;the UK is open for business and open for crypto businesses&rdquo;, it seems a fitting time for Philipp Plein to announce the launch of their crypto-forward flagship store in London.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

      '<p>Luxury fashion retailer Philipp Plein is set to open a store in London&rsquo;s Mayfair on Thursday, with the unique option for customers to pay for their purchases in crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Last year, Phillip Plein claimed to be the first fashion brand to accept payment in both fiat and cryptocurrency in their bricks-and-mortar retail stores and online. Now, the german brand is taking their store to London.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fashion store will initially open as a pop-up, with plans to permanently open over five storeys on the iconic Bond street. As an early adopter of technology in the fashion world, Philipp Plein was one of the first fashion brands to develop an in-house e-commerce platform, as well as advocate for the use of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>The Bond street flagship store has revealed it will accept 20 of the leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and expects around 5% of its sales to be paid in cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We chose London first partly because the British government made a big statement about being a world leader in cryptocurrency and it announced plans to mint its own NFT (non-fungible-token) a few weeks ago.Also because London is a huge financial hub and one of the most important cities in the world. We got an opportunity to test it with an international audience in a prime location. If we want to play with the big boys we have to be here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In a press release last year, Phillip Plein set out the fashion brands intention to accept cryptocurrency as payment, noting:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I believe that cryptocurrencies are the future and my team and I have made a major commitment in time and resources, performing all necessary system modifications to adopt this new type of currency,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Phillip Plein shared his personal views on crypto and the future of digital currencies, via Twitter, noting the following:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I am a crypto investor and I believe in the future of CRYPTO - this is why I decided to offer this payment method in my stores and online !!!! have fun guys and enjoy shooting CRYPTO COINS in our wallet - together we are making HISTORY&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>With the UK recently laying out plans for London to become a &lsquo;global hub&rsquo; for crypto, and city minister John Glen stating &ldquo;the UK is open for business and open for crypto businesses&rdquo;, it seems a fitting time for Philipp Plein to announce the launch of their crypto-forward flagship store in London.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.

Argo bought 20,000 Bitmain S19J Pro machines in September of last year. Additionally, it <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/137672/argo-blockchain-and-core-scientific-swap-bitcoin-mining-fleets">closed a swap deal with Core Scientific</a> to receive approximately 10,000 units already hosted by the latter.</p>\n<p>The company secured several millions of dollars in the past few months in order to support the expansion to Texas. Most recently, it announced an agreement with crypto financial services firm NYDIG for <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/145064/argo-secures-up-to-70-6-million-in-loans-for-texas-mining-facility">up to $70.6 million in financing</a>.</p>\n<p>The Texas facility, dubbed Helios, has access to an extra 600 megawatts of energy, which the company plans on using in future development phases in years to come, per the announcement. If used to full capacity, it could put Argo\'s hashrate close to 20 EH/s, the company said.</p>\n<p>Argo is headquartered in London, UK and has two other facilities in Quebec. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and launched an IPO in the United States last year.</p><br/><p><span class="font-body font-size-7;">© 2022 The Block Crypto, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

    content:
      '<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin miner Argo’s revenue grew by 291% to a total of $100.1 million in 2021 compared to the previous year, the company </span><a href="https://twitter.com/ArgoBlockchain/status/1519559569952886784/photo/1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">announced Thursday</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argo credited the results to a “significant increase” in hashrate, the “temporary drop in difficulty on the Bitcoin network” and higher bitcoin prices in 2021.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Argo mined a total of 2,045 bitcoin — a 17% drop compared to the previous year, which the firm attributed to the block reward halving in 2020.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As per the announcement, the company’s mining margin was 84%, again largely due to Bitcoin price during the year, as well as the drop in hashrate globally following China’s crackdown.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The company shared a few other figures: EBITDA was $71.4 million (a 594% increase compared to the previous year), net income was $41.5 million (a 2,033% increase) and the company’s total cash and digital assets as of December 2021 were $124.9 million based on the bitcoin price at that time.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As of March 2022, Argo held 2,700 bitcoin and bitcoin equivalents, worth $122.9 million.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Argo is headquartered in London, UK and has two facilities in Quebec and another one in Texas.</span></p><br/><p><span class="font-body font-size-7;">© 2022 The Block Crypto, Inc.

      '<p>Luxury fashion retailer Philipp Plein is set to open a store in London&rsquo;s Mayfair on Thursday, with the unique option for customers to pay for their purchases in crypto.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Last year, Phillip Plein claimed to be the first fashion brand to accept payment in both fiat and cryptocurrency in their bricks-and-mortar retail stores and online. Now, the german brand is taking their store to London.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fashion store will initially open as a pop-up, with plans to permanently open over five storeys on the iconic Bond street. As an early adopter of technology in the fashion world, Philipp Plein was one of the first fashion brands to develop an in-house e-commerce platform, as well as advocate for the use of cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<p>The Bond street flagship store has revealed it will accept 20 of the leading cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum, and expects around 5% of its sales to be paid in cryptocurrencies.</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;We chose London first partly because the British government made a big statement about being a world leader in cryptocurrency and it announced plans to mint its own NFT (non-fungible-token) a few weeks ago.Also because London is a huge financial hub and one of the most important cities in the world. We got an opportunity to test it with an international audience in a prime location. If we want to play with the big boys we have to be here.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>In a press release last year, Phillip Plein set out the fashion brands intention to accept cryptocurrency as payment, noting:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I believe that cryptocurrencies are the future and my team and I have made a major commitment in time and resources, performing all necessary system modifications to adopt this new type of currency,&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, Phillip Plein shared his personal views on crypto and the future of digital currencies, via Twitter, noting the following:</p>\n\n<p>&ldquo;I am a crypto investor and I believe in the future of CRYPTO - this is why I decided to offer this payment method in my stores and online !!!! have fun guys and enjoy shooting CRYPTO COINS in our wallet - together we are making HISTORY&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>With the UK recently laying out plans for London to become a &lsquo;global hub&rsquo; for crypto, and city minister John Glen stating &ldquo;the UK is open for business and open for crypto businesses&rdquo;, it seems a fitting time for Philipp Plein to announce the launch of their crypto-forward flagship store in London.</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: This article is provided for informational purposes only.
